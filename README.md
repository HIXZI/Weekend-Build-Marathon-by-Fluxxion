**Stellaris Travel: Aethelgard Expeditions | The Glimmering World**

**Project Overview**

This repository showcases the Stellaris Travel frontend experience, a luxury, near-future space-tourism service offering expeditions to the newly discovered exoplanet, Aethelgard: The Tidally Locked Gem.

The goal of this project is to deliver a highly responsive, modern, and immersive website that captures the dark, neon-lit aesthetic of deep space travel while detailing the unique, bioluminescent wonders of the destination. This is a comprehensive frontend development exercise focusing on complex UI flows and visual storytelling.

**Destination: Planet Aethelgard**

Aethelgard is a world of stark contrasts, featuring the eternally sunlit Sunken Spires on the Day Side and the vast, misty, bioluminescent Aethel-Sea covering the Night Side. The website highlights key logistical and experiential features:

**Propulsion:** Detail on the Aethel-Powered Drive for fast, zero-emission travel.

**Transit:** Information on the pre-flight Zero-G Training and the use of patented Cryo-Sleep Optimization pods during the 3-month subjective travel time.

**On-World Travel:** Showcasing Sky-Shuttles for silent, magnetic levitation between destinations.

**Key Frontend Features & Scope**

The application is built around the traveler's journey, from initial interest to final booking confirmation:

**Immersive Landing Page:** A dark, space-themed hero section (Aethelgard Expeditions) with immediate calls-to-action.

**Expedition Details:** Dedicated pages detailing Aethelgard's unique features, travel protocols, and the full Journey Timeline.

**Tiered Package Showcase:** Clearly presented expedition options:

The Observer (7-Day stay at the Spires Station).

The Deep Diver (14-Day stay including a submersible descent into the Aethel-Sea).

The Pioneer (30-Day personalized tour with private yacht).

**Booking Flow:** A multi-step form simulating the secure booking process (Confirm Your Journey to Aethelgard), including package selection, traveler details, and departure cycle scheduling.

**Aesthetics:** Consistent use of a dark theme, neon typography (blue/purple), and clean, bordered card components for a futuristic, high-tech feel.

**Responsive Design:** Full optimization to ensure the starfield background and content cards look great on all devices.

**Technology Stack**
